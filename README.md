# Pathing
Open source Project especially developed for CS50x 2020. This app is a tool for achieving objictives, any objective can be tracked with that application (when done). You can track a new language you are learning, a tecnology you want to masterize, a habit tracker to gain muscle mass, a project you are developing. Superficially speaking: you set-up a Path, create steps and the final step, for each step you add tasks, you can add subtasks also if it is something complex. Than you complete, subtasks, tasks, steps, complete it all until you reach your objective. The especial thing in using this app, will be you staying motivated with every step or task completed. Get discouraged? see all your steps completed, see what you already did and continue dooing it. At the final store a photo or print of the moment of completion, it will be great for remeber and get more motivated to do more.
